This site was developed as my final project at Full Sail University.  
The site is designed to take the paper out of character creation and gameplay for the Pathfinder tabletop RPG.  
If you're not familiar with the game, that's okay.  The site basically just tracks information about a character that you create for the game.  
You enter some stats, take notes, etc, and this application tracks all of that for you.  
It also will help with some of the tedious calculations that go into creating a Pathfinder character.

For this site, I created an RFP in Abobe Illustrator, as well as a wireframe and full site design.  
After which, I designed and created the database, built out the front-end functionality with Angular JS, and styled the site with SASS and CSS.  

A working version of this site can be found via my portfolio: [AndrewKroft.com/portfolio_projects/spellbacus_updated](http://andrewkroft.com/portfolio_projects/spellbacus_updated/#/home)

I hope you enjoy =)
